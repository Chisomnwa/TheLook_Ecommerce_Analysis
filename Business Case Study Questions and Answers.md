## <p align="center"> Business Questions

The purpose of this analysis is to understand and answer some business questions, gain insights and provide some recommendation to increase revenue.

In this analysis, we will be focusing on orders that were not ***cancelled*** or ***returned*** since we will be dealing with metrics related to revenue.

And this analysis was carried out as of September, 6th 2023.

### 1. How much are we selling monthly? Is it high or low compared to last month?

### Steps:
  
* Use EXTRACT function to get the unique month numbers.

* Get the revenue by multiplying the sale price with the number of items sold.

* Use the DISTINCT function to get the unique orders placed and the user ids who made a purchase.

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM oi.Created_at) AS months,
  --DATE_TRUNC(DATE(oi.Created_at), MONTH) AS order_date,
  ROUND(SUM(oi.sale_price * o.num_of_item), 2) AS revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) AS order_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT oi.user_id) AS customers_purchased
FROM bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items oi
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders` AS o 
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE oi.status NOT IN ('Cancelled', 'Returned')
GROUP BY months
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

### Output:
months | revenue | order_count | customers_purchased
-- | -- | -- | --
8 | 2024225.98 | 12925 | 11838
7 | 1730887.66 | 10690 | 10048

12 | 1028928.7 | 6155 | 5995
1 | 1014080.3 | 6494 | 6275
2 | 986666.35 | 6246 | 6059
10 | 895719.13 | 5525 | 5377
11 | 881674.83 | 5599 | 5440

### Insights
* Revenue has increased steadily

* Total orders and the total number of customers also increased.

* The total number of customers for each month was greater than the total number of orders placed. This means that customers were placing more than one order at a time.

###  2. Who are our customers? Which country do we have major customers coming from? Which Gender and Age group brought in the most profit?

### a. Customers by Country

### Steps:
* Use a CTE to get the distinct user id, country, and the total number of users or customers who were male or female.

* From the CTE, SELECT the country, count of distinct customer ids, and count of customers who were male or female.
	
```sql
WITH customers AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT oi.user_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN u.gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE null END) AS male,
    SUM(CASE WHEN u.gender = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE null END) AS female,
    u.country AS country
    FROM bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items AS oi
    INNER JOIN bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.users AS u
    ON oi.user_id = u.id
    WHERE oi.status not in ('Cancelled', 'Returned')
    GROUP BY user_id, country
    )

SELECT
  country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS customers_count,
  COUNT(female) AS female,
  COUNT(male) AS male
FROM customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customers_count DESC;
```

### Output:
country| customers_count| female | male
-- | -- | -- | --
China | 22406 | 11064 | 11342
United States | 14908 | 7488 | 7420

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN u.age < 12 THEN 'Kids'
    WHEN u.age BETWEEN 12 AND 20 THEN 'Teenagers'
    WHEN u.age BETWEEN 20 AND 30 THEN 'Young Adults'

### 8. Create a query to get frequencies, average order value, and the total number of unique users where status is completed grouped by month (Skillset: Intermediate SQL)

### Steps:

* Use the FORMAT_DATE function to format the created_at date column into a "Year-Month" format and assign it the alias month_year.

* Calculate the ratio of the count of unique order_id to the count of unique user_id, round the result to two decimal places, and assign it the alias frequencies.

* Calculate the average order value by dividing the sum of sale_price by the count of unique order_id, rounding the result to two decimal places, and assigning it the alias Average_order_value.

```sql
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATE("%Y-%m", created_at) AS month_year,
  ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)),2) AS frequencies,
  ROUND((SUM(sale_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)),2) AS Average_order_value,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_unique_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items`
WHERE status = 'Complete'
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year DESC;
```

## Output:

And here are the results for the firs 10 rows:

month_year | frequencies | AOV | total_unique_users
-- | -- | -- | --
2023-09 | 1.09 | 87.73 | 1327
